# Dual-Process Theory

The **Dual-Process Cognitive Model** serves as the foundation for our metacognitive framework, describing how reasoning can be divided into two complementary modes of thought.

## System 1: Intuitive Reasoning
- Fast, automatic, and effortless  
- Relies on heuristics and pattern recognition  
- Used in familiar or low-stakes situations  
- Analogous to the *“teacher”* or *“reflexive”* process in LLM ensembles  

**Examples:**
- Rapid language predictions  
- Context-based completions  

---

## System 2: Reflective Reasoning
- Slow, deliberate, and analytical  
- Involves controlled processing and self-evaluation  
- Activated under uncertainty or high cognitive demand  
- Analogous to the *“student”* or *“rational”* process in ensemble coordination  

**Examples:**
- Multi-step reasoning  
- Self-correction after reflection

## System Interactions

Transitions between System 1 and System 2 occur dynamically, depending on:
- **Confidence levels** of intermediate outputs  
- **Error detection** or self-uncertainty  
- **Metacognitive triggers** (e.g., inconsistency, task complexity)  

In LLM ensembles, this transition is modeled through the **Metacognitive State Vector (MSV)**, which quantifies awareness, confidence, and adaptability during reasoning.
